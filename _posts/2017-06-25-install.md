After a fresh install of an operating system ([Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/) this afternoon for the record) there is the probably bigger task of getting all the applications etc set up and working. None of this is particularly rocket science but the quite a few caveats and little bits and pieces to getting everything how I want it. These are my notes to save me forgetting steps in the future.

### Update all the packages in the repositories

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Gdebi is worth having around to help with other installations.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
```

### Some straightforward things

Some occasionally used programmes and bits and bobs, nothing with much in the way terribly difficult installation.

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
- [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/)
- LaTeX and [texstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)

```bash
sudo snap install inkscape
sudo apt-get install dia
sudo apt-get install texlive-full texstudio
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
sudo apt-get install gawk
```

[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) is available by default on Ubuntu 16.04 but install with `sudo apt install snapd` if not.

### Ruby and Jekyll

```bash
ruby --version
```

Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't seem to come with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) as default, but it is needed for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so grab both.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
```

There are some other necessary ruby gems still missing. Making a test Jekyll website will flush these out. (It will ask for a password to allow it to "sudo" [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)).

```bash
jekyll new test1
```

### Pandoc

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) can be installed with a straightforward `sudo apt-get install pandoc` but the Pandoc website advises against this as the version in the repository is rather out of date. Instead get the latest version from the [pandoc github page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases) - check the filename for the `wget` command.

```bash
wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.17.0.1/pandoc-1.17.0.1-1-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi pandoc-1.17.0.1-1-amd64.deb
rm pandoc-1.17.0.1-1-amd64.deb
```

### Atom

This [text editor](https://atom.io/) continues to grow on me. It is not in the official repositories so add a PPA. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required for atom so is installed if not already.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install atom
```

Atom has highlighting for a number of languages out of the box but not R or Haskell so add these along with AWK (for pure bloodimindedness reasons) from *Install a package* on the "Get to know atom" page.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) should have been installed with Atom (`git --version` to check, otherwise `sudo apt-get install git`). Git wants some configuration information:-

```bash
git config --global user.name "<name>"
git config --global user.email <email address>
git config --list
```

Create an SSH key to connect to [Github](https://github.com/) with. There is clear documentation of this [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and I'm basically following that here. Can check for an existing SSH key with `ls -al ~/.ssh`, but obviously there shouldn't be one on a clean install.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<email address>"
```

Press enter to save in the default location. Type and repeat a passphrase. The passphrase can be given to an SSH agent to avoid retyping it frequently and the key given to github:-

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
sudo apt-get install xclip
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

The public key should now be on the clipboard and can be pasted into github ("Settings" > "SSH and GPG keys"). Test this with `ssh -T git@github.com` and answer "yes" at the prompt.

### LibreOffice

[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) should be installed by default but the UK dictionary isn't. From *Writer*, select *Tools*, *Spelling and Grammer*, *Options*, *Get more dictionaries online*. A British dictionary is bundled with other English (US, Australian, etc) dictionaries, so search for "English".

### R and R Studio

It seems best to add one of the [R mirrors](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) to apt's list of sources:-

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

and add a couple of lines at the bottom:-

```
# Repository for R
deb https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/
```

Now add the R key to Ubuntu's keyring and install R.

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
```

[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) doesn't seem to be in a PPA or similar, which is a bit irritating so need to install it manually. Gdebi helps. Check the R studio website to make sure the `wget` command is getting the latest version.

```bash
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.0.143-amd64.deb
```

Lets check the download integrity with `md5sum` before installing. The checksums are on the R studio website. `md5sum` expects to be passed a file as input with each line containing a checksum and a matching file name. `echo` will create such a file - one line long as there is only one file to check.

```bash
echo 75761eae209158d8415d562b3771fbec rstudio-1.0.143-amd64.deb >rstudio.md5
md5sum -c rstudio.md5
```

Carry on with the installation:-

```bash
sudo gdebi -n rstudio-1.0.143-amd64.deb
rm rstudio-1.0.143-amd64.deb rstudio.md5
```

I want to install the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) set of R packages. This seems to require a couple of other things to be in place before running the `install.packages()` command in R, otherwise there are errors with a couple of the packages. The last library is not necessary for the tidyverse libraries but is for [googleAuthR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleAuthR/index.html).

```
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
```

Load up R Studio and hopefully we can now install the R packages.

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "googleAuthR"))
```

It is probably still worth watching the R output to make sure there are no futher errors to sort out.

### Cochrane RevMan

[Cochrane RevMan](http://community.cochrane.org/tools/review-production-tools/revman-5) is a bit of software for systematic reviews. It is a slight pain to set up under linux so I'm going to put this in a separate post. I think they are planning to replace it with a web based version in due course.

### Qt

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/download/) is free to download provided you use the [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) for stuff created with it. It also requires registration. As always, check the current filename.

```
wget http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
chmod +x qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
./qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
```

The installer will ask for an email address and password. It is possible that Qt wants some [additional libraries](https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu) but these were all in place already for me. Finally clean up the installer.

```
rm qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
```

### Cleaning up at the end

May need to remove any downloaded .deb etc files with `rm` if not done so after individual programme installs. There may also be a need to run autoremove:-

```
sudo apt autoremove
```
